Angular Fundamentals Course
========================

The course is NOT currently up to Date.

Angular Seed has been updated, and the section on Angular Seed in Module 1 is out of date. Also, the introduction in Module 2 which takes Angular Seed and modifies it is out of date. To get around this, please download the Angular Seed zip from this repository and use it in place of the current Angular Seed. The latest Angular Seed project doesn't have anything in it that we utilize in this course, so the older version of it works just fine.
